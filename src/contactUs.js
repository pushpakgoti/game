          At Octopus Gaming, we value and respect intellectual property rights.
          Many of the games available on our platform are either developed
          in-house or licensed directly from known copyright holders. However,
          some games, due to their general use across the internet or a lack of
          identifiable copyright information, may not have a traceable origin.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg font-semibold">
          In certain cases, we use games under specific conditions, ensuring
          that Octopus Gaming meets all prerequisite constraints as far as we
          have been able to determine.
